# Pattern-Problems
This repository consists of various pattern problems in C++ including their solution starting from easy level going to hard level.

### Getting Started
* Windows users must have codeblocks or any similar C++ IDE installed on their system to run and code in C++.

	[Download Codeblocks here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/16.01/Windows/codeblocks-16.01mingw-setup.exe)

* MacOS users can either use XCode or the terminal for compilation of files (latter is recommended)

* Linux users have to do this from terminal 

#### Pattern 1:

```
N = 4

	1 1
	1 1 1
	1 1 1 1
```
